Ploppy Text is a program &amp; library for sending out texts and emails.  It's
great communication for businesses, and school clubs.

## Install

## TODO
* A GUI for Ploppy Text.
* Don't Require the user to research the carrier on [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/lookup).
* Less dependencies.
* Integration with Facebook Messenger ( if possible ).
* A ploppy-text messaging app ( that combines WiFi direct, EMail, Hangouts, Facebook, and Texting options ... and maybe others ).
